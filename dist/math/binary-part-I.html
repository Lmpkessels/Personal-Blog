                What if I told you 00100110 + 01010111 = 01111101 — and it’s not
                magic, it’s just binary. Here you learn what binary is and how
                binary addition actually works.
              </p>
              <h4 class="sub-post-heading">What is binary?</h4>
              <p class="paragraph">
                Binary is a base-2 number system. Each digit (called a bit)
                holds a value of 1 or 0, think of it like an ON/OFF switch in an
                electrical device.
              </p>
              <ul class="unordered-list-post">
                <li class="list-items-post">1 = ON</li>
                <li>0 = OFF</li>
              </ul>
              <p class="paragraph">
                It’s the language used by computer components and almost all
                modern electronic devices.
              </p>
              <h4 class="sub-post-heading">Why it matters</h4>
              <p class="paragraph">
                Take a 1GiB (gibibyte) of memory, like in your computer’s RAM
                for example. <br />
                That equals:
              </p>
              <ul class="unordered-list-post">
                <li class="list-items-post">
                  2<sup>30</sup> bytes = 1,073,741,824 bytes
                </li>
                <li class="list-items-post">
                  Since each byte is 8 bits, that’s: <br />
                  2<sup>30</sup> × 8 = 2<sup>33</sup> bits = 8,589,934,592 bits
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p class="paragraph">
                We want to make optimal use of this space so the computer is
                created in a way to constantly do binary calculations, adding,
                subtracting, and what you can think of is done by the components
                of a computer.
              </p>
              <p class="paragraph">
                So it can figure out where it should point to in memory, and
                what data should show up, once asked for. Numbers, letters,
                emojis, images, and even the words you’re reading right now are
                all stored in binary.
              </p>
              <p class="paragraph">
                Let’s look at the truth table displayed below containing five
                components to get to the end sum of 2 bytes added up together.
                It shows all input combinations and their resulting byte, which
                you can read downwards in the sum column.
              </p>
              <p class="paragraph">
                Each row represents one bit, starting from the least significant
                (right) to the most significant (left). The remaining byte is
                built by repeating this process 8 times.
              </p>
              <h4 class="sub-post-heading">The 5 components</h4>
              <ul class="unordered-list-post">
                <li class="list-items-post">
                  <b>A = byte_1</b>, starting at the top of the column at the
                  least significant bit.
                </li>
                <li class="list-items-post">
                  <b>B = byte_2</b>, which also starts at the top of the column
                  at the least significant bit.

                <li class="list-items-post">
                  <b>Carry_in</b> the overflow from the previous bit's addition,
                  calculated as carry out divided by 2.
                </li>
                <li class="list-items-post">
                  <b>Sum = (A + B + Carry_in) % 2</b>, and will represent from
                  bit_0 to bit_7 the full byte displayed starting from the
                  rightmost at (bit_0) (least significant) and moving left
                  (bit_7).
                </li>
                <li class="list-items-post">
                  <b>Carry_out = (A + B + Carry in) / 2</b>, this calculation is
                  done so we know if we need to create a carry_in for the next
                  bit addition.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p class="paragraph">
                NOTE: Because computers start at index 0 by default, we do so
                bit_0 in base-10 would represent the number 1 so in total we
                have 8 positions.

              <h4 class="sub-post-heading">The truth table explained</h4>

              <p class="paragraph">
                <b>Carry_in</b> is the overflow of the previous calculation.
                Once we have a carry_in we know that the previous
                <b>Carry_out</b> calculation was 1 bit overflow, remember:
                <br /><b>Carry_out is the total A + B + Carry_in / 2.</b>
              </p>
              <p class="paragraph">
                NOTE: Overflow is the given location in RAM running out of
                space.
              </p>
              <p class="paragraph">
                The Sum, as you’ve read above, sums the whole to the remainder
                of two, it’s used so we know what to write down when the full
                truth table is completed. Which leaves us with the full byte.
              </p>
              <p class="paragraph">
                In this case, 01111101 equals 125 in decimal numbers.
              </p>
              <p class="paragraph">
                The maximum number of bits that can be held in a byte is 8 as
                you probably already guessed, and if each value holds the number
                1 then we have a total of 8 ones => 11111111, leaving us with
                the number 255. Because each one calculated to the power of two
                is; 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1. And all positions add up
                together is 255.
              </p>
