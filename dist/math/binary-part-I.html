                You have <b>input A, input B,</b> and <b>Carry In</b> to

                Then you have <b>Sum</b> and <b>Carry Out</b> both using

                communicates if there’s overflow.

              <p class="paragraph">
                <b>XOR</b> is created by making use of all three basic gates;
                <b>AND, NOT, and OR.</b> In figure 1.0 below I show you an
                example of the <b>XOR</b>
                logic gate using a diagram:

                <b>Figure 1.0:</b> XOR gate built using only basic gates: AND,
                OR, and NOT. Outputs 1 when A and B are different.
              </figcaption>
              <p class="paragraph">
                Which is the definition of XOR: <b>a</b> is true if <b>b</b> is
                false, and <b>b</b> is true if <b>a</b> is false, if <b>a</b> is
                true and <b>b</b> is true then the output is false. Same in, if
                <b>a</b> is false and <b>b</b> is false then the output is
                false.
              </p>
              <p class="paragraph">
                Next, let’s explore how the Sum logic works.
              </p>
              <h3 class="sub-post-heading">How Sum Works Under the Hood</h3>
              <p class="paragraph">
                <b>Sum</b> looks a bit more complex under the hood, but its only
                difference is that it uses the <b>XOR gate twice</b>, as shown
                in figure 1.1.
              </p>
              <img

                alt="Sum simulation using logic gates"
                class="sum-gate"
              />
              <figcaption class="fig-caption">
                <b>Figure 1.1:</b> This XOR circuit follows the logical
                expression: ((a AND NOT b) OR (b AND NOT a)).
              </figcaption>
              <p class="paragraph">
                This <b>Sum circuit follows the logical expression</b>: (a AND
                NOT b) OR (b AND NOT a) = Output, then (CarryIn AND NOT output)
                OR (NOT output AND CarryIn).
              </p>
              <p class="paragraph">
                So simply put, the
                <b>Sum circuit follows 2X the logical expression:</b> ((a XOR b)
                XOR carry in).
              </p>
              <p class="paragraph">
                When the <b>output of Sum</b> is received it’s
                <b>stored in memory.</b>
              </p>
              <p class="paragraph">
                Now, let’s move to the last layer of the full adder.
              </p>
              <h3 class="sub-post-heading">Carry out the last layer</h3>
              <p class="paragraph">
                <b>Carry out</b> is used to detect <b>overflow</b>, if there’s
                overflow then there’s no storage left in memory to point to.
              </p>
              <p class="paragraph">
                <b>Carry out uses 3 gates: AND, OR,</b> and <b>XOR</b>, in
                figure 1.2 below, I illustrate carry out using all three gates:

                As you’ve seen in the three diagrams above, everything can be

              <p class="paragraph">But, why are logic gates used?</p>

                <b
                  >In addition the CPU in your PC communicates through logic
                  gates. A CPU contains transistors which are the starting point
                  before each logic gate, when enough voltage is received at the
                  transistor it communicates ON, if no voltage is received,
                  OFF.</b
                >
                Then it goes through the logic gate, depending on each gate
                logic is applied.

                8-bit full adder) to the most significant bit (MSB) on the left
                hand side (bit_7 in the 8-bit full adder).

              <p class="paragraph">
                Carry_in is the overflow of the previous bit-by-bit calculation.
                Once we Carry_in we know that the previous Carry_out had 1 bit
                that it couldn’t store, called overflow.
              </p>
              <p class="paragraph">
                <b
                  >If at the end of the 8-Bit Full Adder, we end up with one bit
                  overflow</b
                >, then, the result may not fit in 8 bits,
                <b>requiring more memory.</b>
              </p>
              <p class="paragraph">
                This means that the program may not compile for the user if
                memory doesn’t allow, else the CPU adds another byte if memory
                allows.
              </p>
              <p class="paragraph">
                The <b>Sum tells the CPU which value to store in memory</b>,
                after the 8-bit full adder completes.
              </p>
              <p class="paragraph">
                After pressing (=) on your calculation app the CPU follows this
                8-Bit full adder and decimal number 195 is shown.
              </p>
              <p class="paragraph">
                And just like that, you’ve seen how your phone adds 120 + 75,
                one bit at a time.
