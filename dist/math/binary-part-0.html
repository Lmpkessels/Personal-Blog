                It’s Friday morning and you're reading the news on your laptop,
                then, suddenly, you wonder…
              </p>
              <p class="paragraph">
                "How are all these letters and images displayed to me?”
              </p>
              <p class="paragraph">
                That’s binary going through logic gates in your CPU.
              </p>
              <p class="paragraph">
                By the end of this blog, you'll know exactly why computer use
                only 0s and 1s, and how that powers everything from images to
                messages on your screen.
              </p>
              <p class="paragraph">
                In binary, we only have 0 and 1, to represent all numbers and
                data by combining powers of two. That’s different from decimal
                where we use 0-9.
              </p>
              <p class="paragraph">
                Binary is the foundation of computer systems and digital
                communication.
              </p>
              <p class="paragraph">
                CPUs use binary in logic gates; you can see each logic gate as a
                mathematical function, you have input, logic, output. The core
                gates are AND, OR, and NOT. If we combine these, we can create
                more complex logic gates, like XOR, NAND, and 2 more.
              </p>
              <p class="paragraph">
                Logic gates follow Boolean rules — true/false, on/off — and are
                physically built using transistors. Each gate performs a basic
                operation like AND, OR, or NOT using electric signals.
              </p>
              <p class="paragraph">A transistor acts like a digital switch:</p>
              <ul class="unordered-list-post">
                <li class="list-items-post">1 = Electricity flows (on)</li>
                <li>0 = no flow (off)</li>
              </ul>
              <p class="paragraph">
                If you’re reading this blog from your macbook with a K2 chip
                then your chip contains “~20 Billion transistors, each acting as
                an on/off switch letting your computer process data
                lightning-fast.” so you can read the right message from your
                screen.
              </p>
              <p class="paragraph">
                “Your computer reads each tiny switch (a bit) as either 1 (on)
                or 0 (off).”
              </p>
              <p class="paragraph">
                Each bit has a weight. Starting at the right, Least Significant
                Bit (LSB) moving to left, Most Significant Bit (MSB), their
                values are:
              </p>
              <div class="display-row">
                <div class="text">
                  (MSB) 2<sup>7</sup>, 2<sup>6</sup>, 2<sup>5</sup>,
                  2<sup>4</sup>, 2<sup>3</sup>, 2<sup>2</sup>, 2<sup>1</sup>,
                  2<sup>0</sup>
                  (LSB)
                </div>
              </div>
              <p class="paragraph">(in an 8-bit byte).</p>
              <p class="paragraph">
                In Computer Science we start counting from 0, so in this example
                we go from index 0 to index 7, in decimal that would be 1 to 8.
              </p>
              <p class="paragraph">
                As you can see in this example each bit value is calculated as 2
                raised to the power of its position. Its index position tells us
                how many times we need to do a calculation to the power of two
                starting from zero.
              </p>
              <p class="paragraph">
                So if we take the Most Significant Bit (MSB) all the way on the
                left, then we would have to do, two to the power of seven. And
                net a decimal number of 256.
              </p>
              <p class="paragraph">
                All thanks to logic gates in your CPU that groups 8 bits into
                one byte. With a byte we can create a total of 256 unique
                combinations and store data.
              </p>
              <p class="paragraph">
                Enough to represent characters, colors, numbers, and more.
